The idea behind this bot is fairly simple: let all your admin decision be done by the majority, from the creation of new channels to the kick of annoying users.

For admins that don't feel like letting common folk deciding too dangerous stuffs, it's also possible to disable the commands of your choise.

There is also some protection measure so a random guy won't kick everyone in your server by throwing votes at 4am.
